Since [`ReactiveViewModel`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveViewModel) project felt on stagnation and there's not `Swift` or `Swift 2.0` implementation we found the need to implement something like this on `Swift`.

Given the fact that there's no `Swift` branch and the lack of interest in the project we felt it was better to give `RxSwift`/`RxCocoa` a chance and instead use it as the base for this reactive view model approach.
